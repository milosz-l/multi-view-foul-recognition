Multi-task multi-view video classification can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to classifying types of fouls and their severities in soccer from multiple camera views. We participated in this year's CVPR challenge - the SoccerNet Multi-View Foul Recognition Challenge 2024. Our approach was based on the existing VARS model. We experimented with different encoders, optimized frames per second (FPS), and used more aggressive data augmentation strategies. Additionally, we refactored the codebase using PyTorch Lightning to streamline experiment tracking with Weights and Biases. This poster provides a high-level overview of the VARS model architecture and demonstrates the potential of video vision transformers in use cases like this multi-view foul recognition task.
