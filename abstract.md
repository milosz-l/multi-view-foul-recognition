Multi-task image classification is a difficult challenge, and it becomes even more complex when dealing with videos from multiple views. In this presentation, we will talk about our participation in this yearâ€™s CVPR challenge focused on multi-view foul recognition. We will explain how to tackle the difficulties of video classification by using state-of-the-art video encoders for feature extraction, attention mechanisms for combining features, and multi-headed transformer models for classification. We will also share our experiences from the competition, along with practical tips and tricks to help you achieve better results in any machine learning competition in the future.
